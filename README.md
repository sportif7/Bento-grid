## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned using flexbox for structuring element subelements from inside and using grid for giving page outer structure.

### Continued development
Focusing mainly on html and css in my current stage of coding development.

### Useful resources
   I would like to thanks to Josh Comeau for his recently updated CSS reset I use:
   [Josh's Comeau Modern CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)

   Very well explained grid CSS from Jen Simmons.Highly recommended.
